# 1. Given two lists [1,2,3,4] and [3,4,5,6], create a variable called answer, which is a new list that is the intersection of the two. Your output should be [3,4] .  Hint: use the in  operator to test whether an element is in a list.  For example:  5 in [1,5,2]  is True.  3 in [1,5,2]  is False.

# 2. Given a list of words ["Elie", "Tim", "Matt"] create a variable called answer2, which is a new list with each word reversed and in lower case (use a slice to do the reversal!) Your output should be ['eile', 'mit', 'ttam'] 

list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]

list2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]

# answer = [num for num in list1 if (num in list2) is True]
answer = [num for num in list1 if num in list2]


names = ["Elie", "Tim", "Matt"]

answer2 = [name[::-1].lower() for name in names]
print(answer2)
